# Using DevOps

Welcome to the DevOps section.

## Naming Convention

Let's say you have some `foo.com` domain to set up.

Your app needs these 3 sub-domains to work on:

* www.foo.com
* api.foo.com
* admin.foo.com

Now you need to setup a staging environment. Your staging domain will become `staging.foo.com`
and your staging app will work on these 3 staging sub-domains to work on:

* www.staging.foo.com
* api.staging.foo.com
* admin.staging.foo.com
